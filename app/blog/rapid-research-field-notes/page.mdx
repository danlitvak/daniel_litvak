# Rapid Research in Resource-Constrained Teams

When budgets are thin and timelines tighter, research can feel like a luxury. During a residency with CivicLab ATX, we needed insights in weeks—not quarters. Here’s how we combined lightweight diary studies with SMS touchpoints to keep momentum high without burning out community partners.

## Set the cadence early

Participants received a weekly text prompt asking them to photograph or describe the moment they relied on city services. Each submission flowed into an Airtable base that we reviewed live in synthesis sessions.

## Layer qualitative depth when it matters

Every Friday we invited three participants to a 20-minute video call, using their diary entries as conversation starters. The familiarity of SMS made the calls feel like catch-ups rather than formal interviews.

## Package learnings for rapid adoption

We translated insights into decision cards—bite-sized recommendations with opportunity sizing and example quotes. Product managers slotted them directly into their sprint rituals, accelerating alignment.

The result? Stakeholders stayed engaged, residents felt heard, and we shipped prototype updates in half the usual time. If you’re experimenting with similar blended methods, let’s compare notes.
