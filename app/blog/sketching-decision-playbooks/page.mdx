# Sketching Decision Playbooks for Climate Operations

Designing decision-support tools for emergency planners means navigating uncertainty, compressed timelines, and ever-shifting stakeholder priorities. Over the past semester I co-led a studio with civic partners to prototype an incident response console for rising sea levels. These are the facilitation moves that kept our teams aligned.

## 1. Anchor the room with shared signals

We invited dispatchers, field crews, and policy makers to sketch the top three signals that drive their decisions. Within minutes, sticky notes filled the wall with tidal gauges, 311 calls, and dispatch radio chatter. Turning these signals into a living legend inside the prototype helped everyone understand what data mattered—and what to leave out.

## 2. Prototype outcomes, not screens

Instead of walking through static wireframes, we walked through scenarios. Each participant narrated what they would do with new information, and we instrumented those moves as quick Figma overlays. The narrative approach made trade-offs visible and inspired three new automation concepts.

## 3. Close with accountability artifacts

Every session ended with a "decision log"—a simple table that captured new questions, responsible owners, and the date we would revisit the topic. This cadence gave our municipal partners confidence that their input would not disappear into yet another workshop archive.

### Looking ahead

Our next sprint focuses on layering predictive insights on top of field reports. If you have examples of human-in-the-loop dashboards that balance trust and automation, I’d love to hear about them.
