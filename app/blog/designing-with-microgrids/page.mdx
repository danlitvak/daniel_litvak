# Designing with Microgrids in Mind

Our Pulse Beacon pilot paired a low-bandwidth dashboard with solar-powered sensors installed across rural health clinics. Working alongside nurses, technicians, and local electricians reshaped how I think about "done" for connected products.

## Reliability is a conversation

Clinic staff taught us that uptime metrics mean little without context. We added a simple "confidence" indicator powered by technician notes, so everyone knew which readings were verified.

## Offline-first is table stakes

Connectivity dropped multiple times a day. We moved to a progressive web app with offline caching and SMS fallbacks so staff could still acknowledge alerts.

## Make maintenance visible

A printed checklist lives next to each router, showing when batteries were swapped and who to call if something fails. Pairing physical artifacts with software reduced guesswork during audits.

Designing with microgrids forces a balance between ambition and practicality. If you’re working on similar resilience challenges, I’d love to trade stories.
